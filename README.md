github doesn't allow large files, and i don't want to share the code YET. \
***DISCLAIMER - THE USER EXPERIENCE AND GAMEPLAY ARE CURRENTLY AN AFTERTHOUGHT, \
I CREATED THIS GAME TO CHALLENGE MYSELF AND IMPROVE MY PROGRAMMING SKILLS OF GAME FEATURES AND MY SKILLS IN UNITY.
DON'T EXPECT A FULLY DEVELOPED GAME. THIS IS ONLY A DISPLAY OF THE FEATURES MENTIONED BELOW***

This is a game is inspired by the Mechwarrior franchise. \
Features: \
-First person shooter \
-Client-Server Multiplayer \
-Physics based movement with variable speed(inertia, acceleration) \
-Mech customization before spawning in : \
*Multiple weapons that can be mounted to different parts of the mech \
Full armor customization - you can change the armor values of every component. \
Spawn point* \
\
-Heat system: \
*every shot you take will generate some heat. \
different weapons generate different amounts of heat. \
heat slowly dissipates over time. \
going over the maximum heat threshold damages your core.* \
\
-Advanced damage system:  \
*every part of the mech has its own armor and structure values. \
armor only protects the structure and its destruction doesn't affect the combat effectiveness of the mech. \
multiple projectile types, each one has different penetration and damage. \
armor can be penetrated by certain projectiles, part of the damage overflows trough the armor. \
destroying a component that houses a weapon renders the weapon inoperable. \
leg damage slows you down. \
core destruction kills you \
health status of all components is displayed on the HUD in the form of a paper doll of the mech* 

Controls: \
drag sliders to adjust armor values \
W,S - increase or lower desired speed. \
A,D - rotate left/right \
Enter - confirm mech loadout and spawn \
LMB - fire dorsal weapons \
RMB - fire torso mounted weapons \
MMB - fire arm mounted weapons \
 \
Possible planned features -  \
-Better UX/UI \
-customization of controls \
-respawning \
-objectives \
-ability to change IP of the server you're connecting to (this build is currently localhost only, but it is possible to change it to a public server in the build settings) \
-animations \
-map selection on the server side \
-multiple teams and team markers on HUD \
-more mechs, different hardpoint system for weapons
